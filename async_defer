1. NORMAL SCRIPT TAG -> as we click on url, first html parsing start, once the browser find script tag, it 
        paused the html parsing, fetch the script and execute it completely and then resume the html parsing.
        html parsing blocked while fetching and executing the script
2. WITH ASYNC ATTRIBUTE -> in this case, html parsing start and parallely script with async attribute start 
        getting fetch and once script fetched completely and available , browser paused the html parsing and execute
        the script and then resule the html parsing.
        -> html parsing blocked while executing the script. better than normal case.
        -> it does gaurantee the order of execution of the script and use ONLY WHEN all script are independent.
3. WITH DEFER ATTRIBUTE -> in this case, html parsing start and all script with defer get fetch parallely and execute
        once the html parsing finish, so html parsing do not get blocked in this case.
        -> it maintain the order of execution and best of all.
